# DREAM ARTIFACT: OMEGA v19.0
Generated: 2026-02-14 02:31:57.261748

Based on the provided system updates and context, I suggest the following radical evolution for OMEGA v19.0:

Introduce a new Swarm-Human neural synchronization feature that allows agents to synchronize their actions with human users. This will enable more efficient task allocation and collaboration between AI agents and humans.

To implement this, you can modify the existing swarm engine and smart router modules to incorporate communication channels with human users. Additionally, update the dashboard interface to allow for easy toggling between collective and individual agent modes.

This new feature will enhance the system's ability to adapt and respond to dynamic environments while also improving user experience by providing seamless integration of AI agents into daily workflows.
