## Topic 1: Security — Brak sandboxa, brak input validation na wielu endpointach. Co naprawić najpierw?

### Round 1: Analysis

#### STROZ_SECURITY (Security Officer) [qwen3:8b]
1. **Current State**: No sandboxing leaves the system exposed to code execution, while missing input validation risks SQLi, XSS, and command injection (OWASP Top 10). Critical endpoints (e.g., API forms, user data ingestion) lack sanitization, enabling exploitation.  

2. **Proposals**:  
   - **HIGH**: Implement **sandboxing for untrusted code execution** (e.g., Docker containers or Firejail). Prioritize endpoints handling user-generated content (e.g., file uploads, scripts). *Effort: 5–7 days* (setup, config, testing).  
   - **HIGH**: Enforce **strict input validation** on all endpoints. Use OWASP’s *Input Validation* guidelines: sanitize/escape all user inputs (HTML, SQL, OS commands). Focus on high-risk areas (e.g., forms, API payloads). *Effort: 8–10 days* (code changes, testing).  
   - **MEDIUM**: Integrate **automated validation testing** (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) into CI/CD. Validate all endpoints for common vulnerabilities. *Effort: 3–5 days* (tool setup, integration).  

3. **Action Plan**: Start with sandboxing to block runtime exploits. Parallelize input validation fixes for critical endpoints. Use automated tools to scale validation coverage. Prioritize OWASP Top 10 compliance to mitigate immediate risks.

#### TESTER_QA (QA Commander) [qwen2.5-coder:7b]
### Assessment of Current State

The topic highlights a critical security vulnerability: the absence of sandboxes and input validation on multiple endpoints. This issue poses significant risks, as it could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise.

### Top 3 Concrete Proposals with Priority

1. **Implement Input Validation**
   - **Priority:** HIGH
   - **Description:** Add robust input validation to all endpoints to ensure that only expected and safe inputs are processed.
   - **Effort:** 5 days (2 developers)

2. **Create a Sandbox Environment**
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM
   - **Description:** Develop and implement a sandbox environment where untrusted code can be executed safely, preventing any potential damage to the main system.
   - **Effort:** 3 days (1 developer)

3. **Conduct Security Audits**
   - **Priority:** LOW
   - **Description:** Perform security audits on existing endpoints to identify and fix vulnerabilities that may have been overlooked.
   - **Effort:** 2 days (1 QA Engineer)

### Estimated Effort per Proposal

- **Implement Input Validation:** 5 days (2 developers)
- **Create a Sandbox Environment:** 3 days (1 developer)
- **Conduct Security Audits:** 2 days (1 QA Engineer)

### Round 2: Rebuttal

#### STROZ_SECURITY (Security Officer)
**Review of Proposals:**  
**Input Validation (TESTER_QA #1):** Aligns with STROZ_SECURITY’s HIGH priority. However, the effort estimate of 5 days (2 devs) underestimates complexity. Input validation requires deep integration with OWASP guidelines (e.g., sanitization, escaping), testing for SQLi/XSS, and prioritizing high-risk endpoints. Recommend **8–10 days** (as per STROZ_SECURITY) with dedicated security engineers.  

**Sandbox Environment (TESTER_QA #2):** MEDIUM priority is acceptable, but the 3-day estimate is overly optimistic. Sandboxing (e.g., Docker/Firejail) requires setup, config, and rigorous testing. Prioritize **HIGH** for critical endpoints (e.g., file uploads, scripts) to block runtime exploits. STROZ_SECURITY’s 5–7 days is more realistic.  

**Security Audits (TESTER_QA #3):** LOW priority is reasonable as a complementary step, but it should not delay critical fixes. Suggest integrating audits into CI/CD (as per STROZ_SECURITY’s MEDIUM proposal) for ongoing compliance.  

**Combined Recommendations:**  
1. **Prioritize sandboxing** for untrusted code execution (HIGH) to mitigate runtime exploits.  
2. **Enforce strict input validation** (HIGH) on all endpoints, using OWASP guidelines and automated tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP).  
3. **Integrate automated testing** (MEDIUM) into CI/CD to scale validation coverage.  
4. **Audit** as a secondary step, but ensure it’s part of a continuous security program.  

**Challenges:** TESTER_QA’s effort estimates are too low for input validation and sandboxing. STROZ_SECURITY’s proposals are more comprehensive and align with OWASP Top 10 compliance. Combine both approaches for a robust, scalable solution.

#### TESTER_QA (QA Commander)
### STROZ_SECURITY (Security Officer):
**SUPPORT**: The proposals from STROZ_SECURITY are well-aligned with security best practices. Implementing sandboxing and strict input validation are critical steps to mitigate the risks identified.

**CHALLENGE**: While integrating automated validation testing is a good idea, it should be prioritized after addressing immediate vulnerabilities through sandboxing and input validation. Automated tools can complement but not replace manual testing in certain scenarios.

**SUGGESTION**: Consider adding a **MEDIUM** priority for updating documentation on security practices and procedures to ensure that all team members are aware of the new requirements and responsibilities.

### TESTER_QA (QA Commander):
**SUPPORT**: The proposals from TESTER_QA are focused on immediate actions that can be taken to mitigate risks. Implementing input validation is crucial, as it directly addresses the primary vulnerability.

**CHALLENGE**: While creating a sandbox environment is important, it should not be prioritized over fixing existing vulnerabilities. Sandboxing should be implemented after addressing critical security issues to ensure the system's stability and integrity.

**SUGGESTION**: Recommend that TESTER_QA consider **splitting the effort for input validation into two phases**: first focusing on high-risk endpoints (e.g., API forms, user data ingestion) and then expanding to other areas. This approach will allow for more focused testing and quicker mitigation of critical risks.

### Combined Action Plan:
1. **Implement Input Validation** (TESTER_QA):
   - **Priority:** HIGH
   - **Description:** Add robust input validation to all endpoints.
   - **Effort:** 5 days (2 developers)

2. **Create a Sandbox Environment** (STROZ_SECURITY):
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM
   - **Description:** Develop and implement a sandbox environment for untrusted code execution.
   - **Effort:** 3 days (1 developer)

3. **Update Documentation on Security Practices** (STROZ_SECURITY):
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM
   - **Description:** Ensure all team members are aware of the new security requirements and procedures.
   - **Effort:** 2 days (1 QA Engineer)

4. **Conduct Security Audits** (TESTER_QA):
   - **Priority:** LOW
   - **Description:** Perform security audits on existing endpoints to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
   - **Effort:** 2 days (1 QA Engineer)

This combined plan ensures that immediate risks are addressed while also setting the foundation for long-term security improvements.
